    <h1>Geography Notes</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction to Geography</h2>
    <p>Geography is the study of Earth's physical features, climate, and human activities. It is divided into physical geography, human geography, and environmental geography.</p>

    <h2>2. Earths Structure</h2>
    <p>The Earth consists of the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The lithosphere is the rigid outer layer, while the asthenosphere is a semi-molten layer beneath it.</p>

    <h2>3. Landforms</h2>
    <p>Mountains, plateaus, plains, valleys, and deserts form due to geological processes like erosion, weathering, and plate tectonics.</p>

    <h2>4. Climate and Weather</h2>
    <p>Climate is the long-term atmospheric condition, while weather refers to short-term changes. Climate zones include tropical, temperate, and polar regions.</p>

    <h2>5. Water Bodies</h2>
    <p>Oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, and groundwater play vital roles in the hydrological cycle, which includes evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.</p>

    <h2>6. Natural Disasters</h2>
    <p>Earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and floods result from natural processes. Disaster management strategies aim to reduce risks.</p>

    <h2>7. Population Geography</h2>
    <p>Demographics study population density, migration, birth rates, and death rates. Urbanization leads to city expansion and economic growth.</p>

    <h2>8. Economic Geography</h2>
    <p>It examines industries, agriculture, trade, and natural resources. Different economic activities include primary (farming, fishing), secondary (manufacturing), and tertiary (services).</p>

    <h2>9. Environmental Geography</h2>
    <p>Focuses on ecosystems, deforestation, pollution, and conservation. Climate change and global warming are major concerns.</p>

    <h2>10. Geographic Technologies</h2>
    <p>Modern geography uses GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and remote sensing for mapping and analyzing spatial data.</p>
