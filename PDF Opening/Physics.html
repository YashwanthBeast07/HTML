    <h1>Physics Notes</h1>
    
    <h2>Newton's Laws of Motion</h2>
    <p><strong>First Law:</strong> An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</p>
    <p><strong>Second Law:</strong> The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the force applied (F = ma).</p>
    <p><strong>Third Law:</strong> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
    
    <h2>Work, Energy, and Power</h2>
    <p><strong>Work:</strong> Work is done when a force is applied to an object and the object moves in the direction of the force (W = Fd cosθ).</p>
    <p><strong>Energy:</strong> The capacity to do work. It exists in various forms such as kinetic energy (KE = 1/2 mv²) and potential energy (PE = mgh).</p>
    <p><strong>Power:</strong> The rate of doing work (P = W/t).</p>
    
    <h2>Gravitation</h2>
    <p>Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them (F = G(m₁m₂/r²)).</p>
    
    <h2>Electromagnetic Waves</h2>
    <p>Electromagnetic waves are waves that can travel through the vacuum of outer space. They include radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.</p>
    
    <h2>Ohm's Law</h2>
    <p>The current flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance (V = IR).</p>
    
    <h2>Thermodynamics</h2>
    <p><strong>First Law:</strong> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another.</p>
    <p><strong>Second Law:</strong> The entropy of an isolated system always increases over time.</p>
    <p><strong>Third Law:</strong> As temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a system approaches a constant minimum.</p>
    
    <h2>Wave-Particle Duality</h2>
    <p>Light and matter exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, as described by quantum mechanics.</p>
    
    <h2>Relativity</h2>
    <p><strong>Special Relativity:</strong> The laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and the speed of light in a vacuum is constant.</p>
    <p><strong>General Relativity:</strong> Gravity is the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.</p>
    
    <h2>Quantum Mechanics</h2>
    <p>Describes the behavior of matter and energy on very small scales, where classical physics no longer applies.</p>
    
    <h2>Optics</h2>
    <p>The study of light, including reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference.</p>
    
    <h2>Magnetism</h2>
    <p>Describes how materials respond to magnetic fields and the interaction of moving charges with magnetic forces.</p>
    
    <h2>Fluid Mechanics</h2>
    <p>Studies the behavior of fluids (liquids and gases) in motion and at rest.</p>
    
    <h2>Sound Waves</h2>
    <p>Mechanical waves that propagate through a medium, characterized by frequency, wavelength, and amplitude.</p>
    
    <h2>Semiconductors</h2>
    <p>Materials that have electrical properties between conductors and insulators, essential for modern electronics.</p>
    
    <h2>Atomic Structure</h2>
    <p>Describes the composition of atoms, including electrons, protons, and neutrons.</p>
    
    <h2>Nuclear Physics</h2>
    <p>The study of atomic nuclei, their interactions, and nuclear reactions.</p>
    
    <h2>Radioactivity</h2>
    <p>The process by which unstable atomic nuclei lose energy by emitting radiation.</p>
    
    <h2>Superconductivity</h2>
    <p>A phenomenon where certain materials exhibit zero electrical resistance at low temperatures.</p>
    
    <h2>Plasma Physics</h2>
    <p>The study of ionized gases, which are found in stars and fusion reactors.</p>
