        <h1>Economics Notes</h1>
    
        <h2>1. Introduction to Economics</h2>
        <p>Economics is the study of how individuals, businesses, and governments allocate resources to satisfy human wants and needs. It is broadly divided into microeconomics and macroeconomics.</p>
    
        <h2>2. Microeconomics vs. Macroeconomics</h2>
        <p><strong>Microeconomics:</strong> Focuses on individual consumers and firms, supply and demand, and price determination.</p>
        <p><strong>Macroeconomics:</strong> Deals with overall economic performance, inflation, GDP, and government policies.</p>
    
        <h2>3. Supply and Demand</h2>
        <p><strong>Law of Demand:</strong> As price decreases, demand increases, and vice versa.</p>
        <p><strong>Law of Supply:</strong> As price increases, supply increases, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>Market equilibrium occurs where supply meets demand.</p>
    
        <h2>4. Market Structures</h2>
        <p>There are different types of markets:</p>
        <p><strong>Perfect Competition:</strong> Many sellers, identical products, and no market power.</p>
        <p><strong>Monopoly:</strong> A single seller dominates the market.</p>
        <p><strong>Oligopoly:</strong> A few large firms control the industry.</p>
        <p><strong>Monopolistic Competition:</strong> Many sellers with differentiated products.</p>
    
        <h2>5. Factors of Production</h2>
        <p>The resources required to produce goods and services:</p>
        <p><strong>Land:</strong> Natural resources like oil, water, and minerals.</p>
        <p><strong>Labor:</strong> Human effort used in production.</p>
        <p><strong>Capital:</strong> Machinery, tools, and technology.</p>
        <p><strong>Entrepreneurship:</strong> Innovation and risk-taking to start businesses.</p>
    
        <h2>6. Inflation and Deflation</h2>
        <p><strong>Inflation:</strong> The rise in general price levels, reducing purchasing power.</p>
        <p><strong>Deflation:</strong> A decrease in price levels, often leading to reduced economic activity.</p>
        <p>Governments control inflation through monetary and fiscal policies.</p>
    
        <h2>7. Economic Growth and GDP</h2>
        <p><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):</strong> The total value of goods and services produced within a country.</p>
        <p>Economic growth occurs when GDP increases, leading to improved living standards.</p>
    
        <h2>8. Fiscal and Monetary Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Fiscal Policy:</strong> Government spending and taxation to influence the economy.</p>
        <p><strong>Monetary Policy:</strong> Central banks regulate money supply and interest rates.</p>
    
        <h2>9. International Trade</h2>
        <p>Countries trade goods and services to maximize economic benefits.</p>
        <p><strong>Comparative Advantage:</strong> A country specializes in producing goods at a lower opportunity cost.</p>
        <p>Trade policies, tariffs, and globalization impact international trade.</p>
    
        <h2>10. Economic Development and Sustainability</h2>
        <p>Development includes improvements in education, healthcare, and infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Sustainable economics focuses on balancing growth with environmental conservation.</p>
